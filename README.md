strings
=======

This package is no longer supported because it was flagged by Google Dart developers as being published by an unknown person.  
Publisher Unknown.  
As a normal person, I believe that hardly anyone would want to use software from unknown publishers.  

Version: 0.2.1

The 'strings' is a helper for the string transformations which can be useful in the code generators (such as 'camelize', 'escape', 'underscore' etc).

Currently supports the following methods:

- camelize
- capitalize
- escape
- isLowerCase
- isUpperCase
- join
- printable
- reverse
- startsWithLowerCase
- startsWithUpperCase
- toUnicode
- underscore

Other useful methods will be added soon...
